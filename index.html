    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="">
    <p>One thing you should know about me is that I really hate writing generic 'about me' pages. It's always super awkward to generically monologue at a computer screen while the cursor blinks in and out of existence; it's constant motion pressuring one to commit thoughts to the screen.  </p>
